					<h3>Early Evaluators Program</h3>
					<p>I oversaw the early evaluators program for three platforms and shipped these products to over 200+
						customers, including brands such as Chick-Fil-A, Nordstroms, and Mayo Clinic. EEP helps promote the
						products to customers before launch and helps drive interest in our products. I was in charge of
						communications between customers, prioritized customers on the ship list, created evaluator guides to
						give more information per product, and created surveys to provide feedback.</p>

					<h3>Sustainability Analysis</h3>
					<p>This summer, within the retail business unit, I worked closely with sustainability experts. I made a
						sustainability dashboard via Power BI to see if retail was on track to meet our recycled plastic goals.
						I led a sustainability prediction analysis on our recycled plastic goals for the next ten years. I
						presented this analysis at an executive level to inform whether we are on track or not on track for our
						sustainability goals. One of my most significant lasting impacts from this project is that my findings
						and analysis template are used in other business units to evaluate their sustainability goals.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Business Use Cases</h3>
					<p>I created vertical use case-specific customer slides for our sales team to present to customers. I made
						vertical use case slides for retail, hospitality, and healthcare. Although hospitality and retail are
						critical, our team recently saw a huge opportunity to move into banking and healthcare, so I
						collaborated with experts on the business development team to sell and promote our product to those
						specific customers.</p>
